# Rename_Script
 A simple python script with user interface for renaming a huge amount of files all at once, with a push of a button.

# Usage
1. Open either the src.py script through terminal or click on the .exe application located in the dist folder.
2. Follow the instructions on the window that will pop up.
3. And let the program rename all the files.

# Modes
 You can choose the way that you want your files to be renamed: 
 1. By Numerical ascending order.
 2. Keeping only some characters from the begining of the name 
 3. Keeping some characters from the end of the name.
 4. A custom mode that you provide a name for the files. Each file gets a number in the end of its name, from 1 to the maximum number of the files.

# Notes
 - The .exe application was created only for use in Windows with the help of PyInstaller, making it one file for the ease of use.
 - It supports by default 4 file types (.txt, .jpg, .png, .pdf). You can add your own at the designated entry box.
 - There is no function to convert file types. You can only rename a file keeping the format intact, so use the program accordingly.
 
# Warnings
 - If you choose to run the program through the provided .exe application it may be flagged, on the first run, as a Malware from your Antivirus program.
 - Please use the program carefully, i tried my best to provide a stable code that won't cause any harm on your files, but due to its nature, a user error may result to file loss.
