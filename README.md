# Rename_Script
 A simple python script for renaming a huge amount of files all at once with a push of a button.

# Usage
 Open either the src.py script through terminal or click on the .exe application located in the dist folder. Choose your folder (Python 3) or provide the path of the folder (Python 2) when prompted and let the program rename all the files.

# Modes
 You can choose the way that you want your files to be renamed. Either by ascending order, keeping only some characters from the begining of the name or keeping some characters from the end of the name.

# Notes
 The .exe application was created only for use in Windows with the help of PyInstaller, making it one file for the ease of use.
 
# Warnings
 If you choose to run the program through the provided .exe application it may be flagged, before your first run, as a Malware from your Antivirus program.
